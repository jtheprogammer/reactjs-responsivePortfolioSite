          "Former PhD student-turned aspiring developer, who is interested in pursuing a career within the tech field. Learning how to program has been a truly exciting experience, and has given me a largely different perspective on how I see the technology I interact with. I had always been fond of technology and programming, and I had even become expected to start learning R and Python towards the end of my tenure as a doctoral student. Prior to learning this, coincidentally enough, I had thoughts of ending my pursuit for a career as a biologist, and was yearning for a new passion I could sink my academic drive into. After taking some time to look into programming, I was not only fascinated with the logic behind how programming works, but with how much in-depth material is available on the web. My newfound fascination of technology, rigorous academic background and drive to enter the field of programming had eventually led me to leaving my PhD programming with the pursuit of becoming a professional programmer.",

        description: "The beginning of my self-taught journey to becoming a programmer initially began with me aiming to learn the fundamentals of Python for analysis of my own research data, using data science libraries like NumPy and Pandas. Once I had withdrawn from the program, I branched out my learning towards IT and web development. To supplement my learning, I used the various guidelines for CompTIA Exams as a syllabus for the IT and networking concepts I had to learn, while using tutorials on Udemy and Youtube to learn plain HTML, CSS and JS. While I had initially spent equal time focusing on different aspects of tech, I had started putting a greater emphasis on learning frontend web development after creating frontend projects and learning ReactJS. Learning ReactJS was especially useful because it allowed me to further my experience with HTML, CSS and JS, while also providing me a gateway to build off of the front-end concepts I had learned, and more comfortably expand towards other technologies."
