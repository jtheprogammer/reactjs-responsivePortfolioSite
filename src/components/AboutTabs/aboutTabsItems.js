          "Former Immunology PhD candidate-turned aspiring developer, who is interested in pursuing a career within the tech field. Learning how to program has been a truly exciting experience, and has given me a largely different perspective on how I see the technology I interact with. I had always been fond of technology and programming, and I had even become expected to start learning R and Python towards the end of my tenure as a doctoral student. After taking some time to look into programming, I was not only fascinated with the logic behind how programming works, but with how much in-depth material is available on the web. My newfound fascination of technology, rigorous academic background and drive to enter the field of programming had eventually led me to leaving my PhD programming with the pursuit of becoming a professional programmer.",
